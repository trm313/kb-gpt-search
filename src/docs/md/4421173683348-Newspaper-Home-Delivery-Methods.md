_Learn more about the types of delivery methods The New York Times uses to deliver your newspaper._ 

The New York Times offers three types of delivery methods to Home Delivery subscribers:  standard, next day, and mail delivery. The New York Times may use a combination of delivery methods to complete delivery of your newspapers. You can learn more about your newspaper delivery method by visiting [nytimes.com/account](https://nytimes.com/account).

Due to ongoing changes in distribution throughout the United States, changes to the delivery method of your paper may occur after purchasing your Home Delivery subscription. If a distributor is no longer able to support delivery of your paper via your current method, then The New York Times may be able to deliver the paper through another method, in which case you may receive the paper after the publication date.

If there is a change to your delivery schedule or method, The New York Times will notify you prior to the change via email or mail. If the paper can no longer be delivered by a New York Times delivery partner to your area, then should you wish to continue your subscription, you will have the option to sign up for a [Mail Subscription](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/4624543338900).

Standard Delivery
-----------------

Your newspaper is delivered by a New York Times distributor on the day of publication.

Next Day Delivery
-----------------

Your newspaper is delivered by a New York Times distributor the day after publication. For example, if you have next day delivery for your Saturday newspaper, then it will be delivered on Sunday.

Mail Delivery
-------------

Your newspaper is delivered by the postal service instead of a New York Times distributor. Newspapers delivered by mail are subject to postal service delays and processing times, which varies depending on the delivery area.
