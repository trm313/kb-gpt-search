_Learn how to troubleshoot account login issues when using your Apple Sign In credentials._

Apple Sign In allows you to login in to your New York Times account using your Apple account’s login credentials. To use Apple Sign In you must first [connect Apple to your New York Times account](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014887628-Connect-to-your-Google-Facebook-or-Apple-account-to-your-New-York-Times-Account-).

- If you experience any issue with Apple Sign In, we recommend first completing the troubleshooting guides for [login issues on a web browser](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402283653268) or [the mobile apps](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402291579412).

If the troubleshooting guides _do not_ resolve your issue, try each of the options below:

### Verify Your Apple Sign In Login Credentials

When linking your Apple account to your New York Times account, you have the option of hiding your personal email address.

If you choose this option, Apple shares a uniquely-generated address, or “**private relay email address**” with The New York Times instead of your personal email address. You will be required to log in using this private email on non MacOS or iOS devices.

If you experience issues when logging in with the **Continue with Apple** option on non MacOS or iOS devices, you will need to use your private relay email address instead of your personal email address.

To view the private relay email address associated with your New York Times account: Go to your Apple device’s account settings (**Settings > Apple ID > Password & Security > Apps Using Your Apple ID**).

If you do not have a private relay email address attached to your New York Times account or are still experiencing troubles logging in with **Continue with Apple:** Disconnect and reconnect your Apple account.

### Connect/Disconnect Your Apple Account

**I am unable to access my subscription benefits after logging in with Apple**

If you receive an error message during login indicating that your account is not associated with an active New York Times subscription, you may have inadvertently created a second account using your Apple Sign In credentials and will not be able to access your other account with the Apple Sign In option.

To resolve this issue:

1.  [Disconnect your Apple account from your new account](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014887628-Connect-to-your-Google-Facebook-or-Apple-account-to-your-New-York-Times-Account-).
2.  Log in to your New York Times account using the email and password you created during sign up.
3.  Select **Connect** next to Apple in the **email and settings** section of your New York Times account to the new account you created.

**Note**: _If you are unable to recall the password you created during initial sign up (for your original account), you can [change or reset your password](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052335791)._

**I’m Unable to Connect My New York Times account to My Apple Account**
