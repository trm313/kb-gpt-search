      <p>
        Dark Mode allows you to change the display of the The New York Times app
        to a light-on-dark color scheme. Enabling Dark Mode on the app allows
        you to reduce the light emitted from your device and improve readability
        of the app. By default, the app follows the display settings enabled on
        your device. However, app users can change the display settings for The
        New York Times app that override the device’s settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          ><strong>Note</strong>: While you can enable Dark Mode for most of the
          app, Dark Mode will not display in some sections of The New York Times
          app. We are constantly working to improve the app experience for our
          users and will continue to work to have Dark Mode available in other
          portions of the app where it may not currently be available.

      <p>
        To change the display settings for The New York Times app, complete the
        following steps:

      <ol>
        <li>
          Download the newest version of The New York Times app from the Google
          Play Store.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select <strong>Settings</strong> from the <strong>Account</strong> tab
          on the top-right corner of The New York Times app.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the <strong>Theme</strong> section, select the option to enable or
          disable <strong>Dark</strong> or <strong>Light</strong> modes. Or, you
          can select the option to automatically use your device’s display
          settings.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If Dark Mode is not available in The New York Times app, please continue
        to update the app. At this time, Dark Mode will not be available to some
        app users, however, The New York Times will continue to make this option

        The New York Times app requires certain permissions to provide you with
        the best possible reading experience:
      </p>
      <h4><strong> In-app purchases </strong></h4>
      <p>This permission enables you to make purchases within the app.</p>
      <h4><strong>Location </strong></h4>
      <p>
        This permission allows the app to track the state in which you are
        located. The New York Times compiles demographic information about our
        readers in accordance with the
        <a

        >.
      </p>
      <h4><strong>Photos, Media, Files </strong></h4>
      <p>
        This permission allows the app to cache images locally, reducing load
        times for pages you revisit.
      </p>
      <h4><strong>WiFi Connection Information </strong></h4>
      <p>
        This gives the app permission to use available WiFi networks rather than
        your mobile network.
      </p>
      <p>
        If trusted WiFi networks are unavailable or if WiFi is disabled, the app
        will make use of your cellular network (if available). Normal bandwidth
        and usage charges apply as detailed in your service agreement with your
        wireless carrier.
      </p>
      <h4><strong>Device ID and Call Information </strong></h4>
