        When linking your Apple account to your New York Times account, you have
        the option of hiding your personal email address.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose this option, Apple shares a uniquely-generated address, or
        “<strong>private relay email address</strong>” with The New York Times
        instead of your personal email address. You will be required to log in
        using this private email on non MacOS or iOS devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you experience issues when logging in with the
        <strong>Continue with Apple</strong> option on non MacOS or iOS devices,
        you will need to use your private relay email address instead of your
        personal email address.
      </p>
      <p>
        To view the private relay email address associated with your New York
        Times account: Go to your Apple device’s account settings (<strong
          >Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Password &amp; Security &gt; Apps Using
          Your Apple ID</strong
        >).

        If you do not have a private relay email address attached to your New
        York Times account or are still experiencing troubles logging in with
