    The New York Times offers three types of delivery methods to Home Delivery
    subscribers:&nbsp; standard, next day, and mail delivery. The New York Times
    may use a combination of delivery methods to complete delivery of your
    newspapers. You can learn more about your newspaper delivery method by
    visiting <a href="https://nytimes.com/account">nytimes.com/account</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Due to ongoing changes in distribution throughout the United States, changes
    to the delivery method of your paper may occur after purchasing your Home
    Delivery subscription. If a distributor is no longer able to support
    delivery of your paper via your current method, then The New York Times may
    be able to deliver the paper through another method, in which case you may
    receive the paper after the publication date.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there is a change to your delivery schedule or method, The New York Times
    will notify you prior to the change via email or mail. If the paper can no
    longer be delivered by a New York Times delivery partner to your area, then
    should you wish to continue your subscription, you will have the option to
    sign up for a

  <h2>Standard Delivery</h2>
  <p>
    Your newspaper is delivered by a New York Times distributor on the day of
    publication.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Next Day Delivery</h2>
  <p>
    Your newspaper is delivered by a New York Times distributor the day after
    publication. For example, if you have next day delivery for your Saturday
    newspaper, then it will be delivered on Sunday.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Mail Delivery</h2>
  <p>
    Your newspaper is delivered by the postal service instead of a New York
    Times distributor. Newspapers delivered by mail are subject to postal
    service delays and processing times, which varies depending on the delivery
    area.
