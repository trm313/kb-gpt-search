        The New York Times offers a variety of billing cycles to subscribers.
        The most common payment cycle is every four weeks, which can result in
        two billing cycles (two charges) occurring in the same month.

    <div class="accordionItemContent">
      <p>There are many reasons why a payment may be declined, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Insufficient funds</li>
        <li>Canceled or expired card</li>
        <li>
          A transaction is flagged by your bank or credit cardâ€™s fraud
          prevention system
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your bank is ultimately responsible for approving or declining charges.
        We recommend paying with an alternate form of payment and contacting
        your bank to understand why a charge was rejected.

        All subscriptions are billed in advance of the current service period.
        If a credit from a missed paper or delivery suspension is not reflected
        on your most recent invoice, that credit will be applied to the next
        service period and reflected on your next billing invoice.

      <p><strong>Why Has My Check Not Processed Yet?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Checks can take up to 21 business days from the date they are mailed to
        be processed. If 30 business days have passed since you mailed your
        check and you do not see your payment reflected in your account, this is
        a good indication that we may not have been able to process your
        payment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why Was My Check Not Processed by The New York Times?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The New York Times may be unable to process your check payment for the
        following reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The check was mailed to the wrong address.</li>
        <li>
          The invoice payment slip attached to your invoice was not included
          with your check payment in the return envelope.
        </li>
        <li>
          The check was not completed with the correct information, and could
          not be processed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The New York Times account number provided on the check does not match
          the account number on your subscription.
        </li>
        <li>
          If our bank was unable to process your payment for any reason, the
          check is then voided, mailed back to The New York Times, and shredded.
        </li>
